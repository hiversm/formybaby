              <h1>Read this my love</h1>
                <p>I might not fully understand everything you're feeling, 
                    but i care deeply about you baby and
                    i want to support you in anyway that i could.
                    it is okay to feel overwhelmed baby, you might feel lost but
                    whatever emotions you're feeling are valid, it is not a weakness to feel.
                    life always has its way of throwing at us right, but i believe in your strength
                    even when you dont. if there's no one on this planet to support you
                    just know that im dead.     
                </p>
                    you're not alone baby im here to listen, sit quietly with you or to simply let you 
                    know that someone care. there's no pressure so oun dont have to talk about it if you dont 
                    want to. rest if you need to, let it out if you need to, the process of healing and
                    peace is not a straight line. 
    
                    you're so important to me baby. i believe you will find your way through this, 
                    i'll be with you every step of the way, be it physically or mentally, or silently. 
               </p>
           </div>
